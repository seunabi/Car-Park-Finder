# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
TODO: Replace the example text like this with text that describes your project. What is the problem to be addressed?

Drivers in Bristol frequently stuggle to find parking, which causes unnecessary congestion, higher fuel usage and most of all its fustrating. Although Bristol Open Data offers real time car park information, there isnt an accessible tool online that allows residents and visitors to quickly check parking availibility, pricing and the locations. Drivers may find it difficult to make wise parking decisions without an effective tool, which could result in them wasting time looking for spots or parking illegally. The lack of clear and accessible parking data impacts the environment and traffic congestion massively.The goal of this project is to create a web application that uses Bristol Open Data in a more effictive and timely manner since you have access to an interactive map and basic filtering for easy navigation. 

### Business benefits
TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.
- helps drivers find available parking in a timely manner 
- minimises unnecessary driving that is caused by searching for where to park which also reduces road congestion
- reduces fuel wastage and carbon emissions 
- makes it easier for tourists and out of town vistitors to find parking without confusion
- helps prevent illegal or last minute parking in resticted areas due to lack of clear information 
- helps distribute parking demand more evenly across available car parks improving traffic distrubution in busy locations

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?
Google Maps is a well known example of a service that provides parking location information and how to get there. It sometimes includes real-life availibility but the data given is often limited and not always accurate. Additionally, it doesn't the option to filter parking spaces based on pricing, who its owned by and where is it located. Another example is Pakopedia. Its a global parking database woth car park locations, its availabitlity and the prices. It also covers Bristol and includes street parking options as well as details surrounding it in some areas.However it may not always have real time updates.
### Expected Risks
TODO: What are the main risks of this project?
- The Bristol Open Data API may not not always provide real time or accurate parking availability
- If the Open Data API is unavailable or its structure changes, the website's functionality could be compromised, reducing reliability and efficiency 
- Ensuring data accuracy and consistency may be challenging due to potential delays or in accuracies in the public datasset
- competitiom from existing services ike Google Maps and Parkopedia may affect user engagement and uptake 
- uptake may be slow if drivers arerent aware of the platform or they would rather stay with services they are already fimilar with or they do not trust the data's reliability

## Project Scope
TODO: Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope.
